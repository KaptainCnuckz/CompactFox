Small update to Compact Fox for minor tweaks I've made for my own personal use. 
- Fixed the font of URLs in the location bar being cut-off
- Removed the garish color swap for inactive tabs so they'll use your theme colors
- Hid the star in the location bar, as a work around for its misalignment

Forked it publically in case anyone wanted to use the same improvements. Enjoy!
